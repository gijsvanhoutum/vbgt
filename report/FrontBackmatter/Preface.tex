% Information on the outline of the report
This report is the result of the 20 week Research Internship performed at the University of Waterloo in Canada within the Multi-Scale Additive Manufacturing Lab. The internship is part of the Systems and Control Master program at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.

% Target Audience
The main targeted audience for this report are people interested in algorithm design for machine vision systems and people within Additive Manufacturing interested in monitoring techniques for deposition based systems.

% Report Usage
Readers interested in hardware selection for triangulation based visual detection should take a look at Chapter \ref{ch:hardware}. Design limitations of algorithm design and previous work done in the field is discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:design}. Chapter \ref{ch:algorithm} presents a new detection algorithm for detection of width and height.

% Acknowledgements
I would like to give special thanks to \myOtherSupervisor for her advice and supervision of the project. Furthermore i would like to thank \mySupervisor for his patience, general advice and mentoring.
